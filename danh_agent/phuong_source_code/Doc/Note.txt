For function calling:
- Agent can do anything customer wanted to do by execute the implemented function.

- Each function like an API to interact with custoemr product

- The ability of Agent is detirment by the knowlegde it have been learn and the number of function.

- For cirpack the function will be something like:

    + GetConfigSection: Main, DNS, PEER, ...
    + GetConfigValue: true, false, "abc", 0 < x < 1000
    + EditConfig: module, Section, value,
    + EditSippScript: message, header, value
    + GetSippScript: Context : if none context return the basic call
    + ExecuteCmd: permisstion, cmd
    + GetSippCmd: scrtipsName, module
    + CollectErrorLog: module

=> For now let just using hardcode function define in the prompt. If in the future have more functions, we need to add a Retival technique to reduce context for functionCallingLLM


WORK FLOW:

- User put all information

- Retival old information about the testing plan:
    + For now skip this part. Paste all TR into LLM. ~5TR is enough.
    + Add 10 TR with same module, and kind of same topic.

- Using LLM, with example context is retrived information. Action is generate new reproduce action need to do for the {problem} by step 1, 2, 3...
    + Using deepseekR1:32B for now. With the context windows give it's some knowlegde to be able to create a new plan.
    + In the future, need to fine tune for more accurate plan

- Testing Agent take this plan. Seperate by step. Each step pick some function: 
    + Write 8 tools
    + Find the way to execute cmd.

- Get the result from testing Agent, then decide to continue or break.
    + Using LLM to decide is this reproduced or not.



=> TO apply on new product what we need:
    + Testing plan for old bug
    + Develop functions (API) to interact with the product
    + If it possible then other CoT dataset for the test plan is really improve the performence.
